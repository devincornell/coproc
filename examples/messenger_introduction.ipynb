    "# Messaging Between Processes: `PriorityMessenger` and `MultiMessenger`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `coproc` messengers are wrappers around standard `multiprocessing.Pipe` objects that create an interface for exchange between processes. There are two primary messenger types that can be used for communications: `PriorityMessenger` and `MultiMessenger`. While they both support the request and channel interfaces, only `PriorityMessenger` supports priorities, as the name would imply. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows how both the host and worker processes maintain separate messengers that allow them to communicate together. While I imagine that some of the messenger features will be most often used on one side or the other (for example, the request/reply interface), the messages are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overview diagram.](https://storage.googleapis.com/public_data_09324832787/coproc_diagram2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic communication.**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `send_norequest()` sends a message without expecting a reply. This is the most basic method for sending data between processes. Specify `channel_id` to send to a specific channel (`None` by default, which is actually a valid channel). The simplest use of messager would be to to send messages back and forth using `send_norequest()`. This is most similar to `pipe.send()` and `pipe.recv()` except that it manages multiple channels (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Channels.** Every message is associated with a channel, which can be any hashable object. \n",
    "    + You can specify the channel using the `channel_id` parameter of most send/receive functions, and the default is `None` - itself a valid, hashable channel id which you may use by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requests.** Using special request and reply methods enables the messenger to track the number of requests sent and replies received so that it can wait for replies to a specific set of requests.\n",
    "    + The requesting process would use `send_request()` to send a request, and the other process would use `send_reply()` so that the requesting process knows that the message is a reply.\n",
    "    + Note that the request tracking happens on a per-channel basis, so you can send multiple requests on different channels and wait for replies to each set of requests.\n",
    "    + `send_request()` will send a message while also incrementing the count of requested messages for the given channel.\n",
    "    + `send_reply()` will send a message while also incrementing the count of received replies for the recipient channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priorities.** By default, the `PriorityMessenger` looks for a `priority` attribute on any messages being sent, and will sort the messages into a priority queue, rather than a standard fifo queue. If the sent item does not have this attribute, by default it is set to `-inf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Messages.** There are several types of special messages that bypass the channel and priority queue interface - they are handled as soon as the messages are received (which occurs when any receive function is called), prior to placement in the queue.\n",
    "    + `send_error()` will send an exception object to the other messenger that will then be raised directly in the recipient process. I recommend using custom exceptions for this behavior.\n",
    "    + `send_close_request()` will send a message that directly raises a `ResourceRequestedClose` exception in the recipient process. Catch this exception in your processes to handle a shutdown. You may want to use this in conjunction with the `.join()` method, which waits for the process to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time one of the following receive methods is called, data will be transferred from the `multiprocessing.Pipe` into the message queue. The following diagram shows the basic flow of data from the pipe to the receive methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Messenger Diagram](https://storage.googleapis.com/public_data_09324832787/messaging_interface2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The receive method you use depends on the desigred behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `available()` loads data from pipe into the queue, and returns the number of available messages on the specified channel. \n",
    "+ `receive_available()` calls `available()` and returns all available messages if there are any. Otherwise, returns an empty list.\n",
    "+ `receive_blocking()` blocks until a message is received on the specified channel, then returns the message.\n",
    "+ `receive_remaining()` yields replies on the specified channel until all outstanding requests have been replied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will give some examples for how to use the messenger interface."
