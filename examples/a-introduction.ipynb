    "## `WorkerResource` and Managing Worker Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WorkerResource` object is the most basic tool for working with concurrent processes. It manages both `Process` and `Pipe` objects wrapped in multi-channel priority queues with robust messaging support. The most common use case is to create a `WorkerResource` object and then manage the resource using a wrapper object. While it does have a built-in context manager for starting and ending the process, you will probably want to create your own outer context manager using the basic `.start()`, `.stop()`, and `.join()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WorkerResource` constructor accepts a class that is used to manage the process. That class' `__init__` method will be called in the host process with a single `PriorityMessenger` argument, and you may pass additional keyword arguments through the `.start()` method. The resulting instance will then be passed to the process for the duration of the `__call__` method, which does not accept any arguments on its own - you must pass any relevant data through the constructor when starting the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class maintains the state of an example worker process. As long as it is alive, it will simply receive data and echo the data back to the host process. Notice that `__init__` accepts the messenger and an additional optional parameter. The messenger is passed automatically, whereas the keyword arguments are passed through the `.start()` method. I will discuss the `.receive_blocking()` and `.send_norequest()` methods in more detail later in the messaging section."

    "# Messaging Between Processes: `PriorityMessenger` and `MultiMessenger`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `coproc` messengers are wrappers around standard `multiprocessing.Pipe` objects that create an interface for exchange between processes. There are two primary messenger types that can be used for communications: `PriorityMessenger` and `MultiMessenger`. While they both support the request and channel interfaces, only `PriorityMessenger` supports priorities, as the name would imply. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic communication.**\n",
    "    + `send_norequest()` sends a message without expecting a reply. This is the most basic method for sending data between processes. Specify `channel_id` to send to a specific channel (`None` by default, which is actually a valid channel). The simplest use of messager would be to to send messages back and forth using `send_norequest()`. This is most similar to `pipe.send()` and `pipe.recv()` except that it manages multiple channels (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Channels.** Every message is associated with a channel, which can be any hashable object. \n",
    "    + You can specify the channel using the `channel_id` parameter of most send/receive functions, and the default is `None` - itself a valid, hashable channel id which you may use by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requests.** Using special request and reply methods enables the messenger to track the number of requests sent and replies received so that it can wait for replies to a specific set of requests.\n",
    "    + The requesting process would use `send_request()` to send a request, and the other process would use `send_reply()` so that the requesting process knows that the message is a reply.\n",
    "    + Note that the request tracking happens on a per-channel basis, so you can send multiple requests on different channels and wait for replies to each set of requests.\n",
    "    + `send_request()` will send a message while also incrementing the count of requested messages for the given channel.\n",
    "    + `send_reply()` will send a message while also incrementing the count of received replies for the recipient channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Priorities.** By default, the `PriorityMessenger` looks for a `priority` attribute on any messages being sent, and will sort the messages into a priority queue, rather than a standard fifo queue. If the sent item does not have this attribute, by default it is set to `-inf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Messages.** There are several types of special messages that bypass the channel and priority queue interface - they are handled as soon as the messages are received (which occurs when any receive function is called), prior to placement in the queue.\n",
    "    + `send_error()` will send an exception object to the other messenger that will then be raised directly in the recipient process. I recommend using custom exceptions for this behavior.\n",
    "    + `send_close_request()` will send a message that directly raises a `ResourceRequestedClose` exception in the recipient process. Catch this exception in your processes to handle a shutdown. You may want to use this in conjunction with the `.join()` method, which waits for the process to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time one of the following receive methods is called, data will be transferred from the `multiprocessing.Pipe` into the message queue. The following diagram shows the basic flow of data from the pipe to the receive methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Messenger Diagram](https://storage.googleapis.com/public_data_09324832787/messaging_interface.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The receive method you use depends on the desigred behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `available()` loads data from pipe into the queue, and returns the number of available messages on the specified channel. \n",
    "+ `receive_available()` calls `available()` and returns all available messages if there are any. Otherwise, returns an empty list.\n",
    "+ `receive_blocking()` blocks until a message is received on the specified channel, then returns the message.\n",
    "+ `receive_remaining()` yields replies on the specified channel until all outstanding requests have been replied to."

In this way, the channels essentially operate as separate pipes.\n",
